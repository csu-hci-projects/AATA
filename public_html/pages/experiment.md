# Participants
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we have limited our participants to only one of our team members' family. These participants willingly volunteered to help in our experiment due to both interest in exercise and video games. The participants range in age (12 - 54), gender (3 male, 3 female) and activity level ranges from little to no exercise - highly active individuals. They have all played dodgeball before, and have some experience playing on the Oculus Quest.

# Apparatus
The hardware that was used to conduct these experiments was the Oculus Quest and a computer. The Oculus Quest allows the user to play the game in a virtual environment. We selected the Oculus Quest as our headset due to ease of access and the reliability of the device. In order to design the virtual game for the headset, we had to use a simple computer that could run Unity. We used Unity to develop a VR friendly game that would provide the user with the best experience possible. Unity is a great platform and provided us with an abundance of documentation. We also chose Unity as it is the most widely used development platform, over 90% of Hololens experiences are made with it\[1\].

# Procedure
To keep things consistent, all participants received the same instructions to eliminate any random variables and inconsistencies between the subjects. The participants also received two sets of instructions for the outside experiment and for the VR experiment. For the outdoor experiment participants were asked to use their fitness tracking wristbands to monitor their heart rate while they play the game. We chose fitness tracking wristbands because some of the participants did not feel confident in measuring their own heart rate, and wristband monitors only have around a 3-4% error rate\[2\]. Only one person didn't have their own and borrowed one for the experiment. The users then were asked to play our version dodgeball where balls are thrown from various locations and at different speeds for five minutes and then answer questions. Afterwards participantâ€™s heart rates were recorded and they have a rating based on how satisfied the activity was for them. 

The VR experiment had more instructions for the participants but with most of them already being familiar with the Oculus Quest it made instructions a lot more simple to explain to the participants. Prior to them starting the experiment the VR was set up and loaded with the game only requiring the participants to press start. They also used the same fitness trackers to monitor their heart rates from the outdoor experiments  Participants were instructed to hold the game controllers parallel to their body and move their entire body in order to dodge the incoming balls. After the game players heart rates were recorded and were also asked to rate their experience with the VR simulation. 

| Participant   | Gender | Age |
| :------------ |:------:| :--:|
| Participant 1 | male   | 52  |
| Participant 2 | male   | 22  |
| Participant 3 | female | 54  |
| Participant 4 | female | 30  |
| Participant 5 | male   | 37  |
| Participant 6 | female | 22  |

We used a total of 6 different people listed on table 1 to conduct this experiment and all participants received the same instructions and demonstrations to keep things consistent among all the tests. We also made sure to ask all the participants for their heart rate at the same time after their experiment to avoid it going down from resting.  

# Task
The task for this experiment is to test the enjoyment and likelihood of performing in a dodgeball type setting (reality and virtual reality) to see if using virtual reality is a liable option to introduce exercise to more people. This task will require the participants to complete a session of dodgeball outdoors, where the participants have to dodge balls that will come to them at various speeds and locations. This task will be repeated but in a virtual environment using an Oculus Quest. During these tasks, we will assess the intensity of the workout as well as the enjoyment and the likelihood of the participants wanting to repeat this exercise. There is a range of variables that will be measured and recorded in order to more accurately come to a valid conclusion that takes in the independent, dependent, random and controlled variables into consideration.

# Variables
In this experiment, there are a lot of variables to take into account. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic we have limited our variables. The independent variables are: setting (VR vs Real Life), Activity level of the Participants (sedentary, light, moderate, very active), and age. The dependent variables are: Heart rate, and user satisfaction (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied). The random variables are: Temperature when experiment was performed, and the speed of which the ball travels. The control variables are: the VR headset used, the instructions we want the participants to follow, and the athleticism of the participant.
