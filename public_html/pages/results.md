# Results
After conducting the experiment and looking at figures 5 and 6, it seems like there was a change in the enjoyment of the participants, and the participants enjoyed the indoor setting of our game versus the outdoor setting. Also, looking at figure 4, the average heart rate for the indoor settings was lower than the outdoor setting, meaning people who do not exercise a lot would have a greater chance of enjoying it as it is not as physically exhausting \[1\].  However, this is not a significant result. After running the one-way ANOVA, it shows after having the participants play in both settings, the difference was not significant ( t = 0.0, df = 10, p > .05 ). Since the p-value > α,  H0 is accepted. The averages of both groups are considered to be equal. However, the difference between the averages of all groups is not big enough to be statistically significant. Due to the pandemic we had to shrink the participant pool, which drastically changed the effectiveness, and the results of this experiment. The smaller the pool, the larger the deviations can be \[2\]. Even though at a glance it looked significant it is because the deviations were big (around 1.87). Thus, we cannot conclude that our indoor game of dodgeball is just as enjoyable as the outdoor counterpart.

# Conclusion
We created a game that attempted to introduce users of various ages and physical activity lifestyles to dodgeball. This was attempted using VR, which allowed the player to move and act as if they were playing the real game. We tested how players would react to the VR and real version of the game while recording data that we later used and discussed in the Results section of our report. Unfortunately, given the global pandemic our sample size was too small and results were inconclusive. We then evaluated how we could improve the game to make it more enjoyable while also trying to get as close as possible to the physical challenge of the real game.

After performing these experiments, we found many interesting takes on performing exercise using Virtual Reality. Although we found that only about half of the participants that we tested were satisfied with the VR activity over the outdoor game, most of them enjoyed it as a fun way to just play a game and compete against each other to see who can perform the best. This may not bring as much physical exertion as outdoor dodgeball but it could prompt users to play it more often which could then lead to more total exercise being done in the long run. This would require more testing and another future experiment to test if users are more likely to keep playing it indoors especially with the current pandemic that is happening. 

There are plenty of features we would implement if there was more time allocated to develop this project. Some of these features include allowing the user to choose from an array of different levels of difficulty so that the experience is personalized to them and their fitness level. Implementing this feature would not be difficult since our logic was designed in such a way we could change the speed at which the dodgeballs are thrown by changing a single variable, spawning a different amount of dodgeballs works similarly. The more challenging part of levels of difficulties would be the unity side of things since implementing a working user interface is something we struggled with. Another feature that could significantly help with immersion would be the addition of realistic physics which was not our focus this semester, realistic physics would match the user’s real life experiences and provide a better overall experience. Lastly, most users tried to catch the dodgeballs out of instinct which unfortunately was not supported.
